# API

The "opfs-tools" library provides three entry functions: "file," "write," and "dir," for accessing files and directories.

```ts
import { file, write, dir } from 'opfs-tools';
import type { OTFile, OTDir } from 'opfs-tools';
```

## file

```ts
<file-api>
```

## directory

```ts
<dir-api>
```

## tmpfile

```ts
<tmpfile>
```
